<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Berserk</h3>
<p>The best historical and philosophical anime ever. Where my favorite character is Griffith but not for his violating
    cause but becuase of his destiny and leadership skill who have a strong ambition. <br />
    <br />
    <strong>here is a best quote of Griffith: </strong> <br />
    <i>"The Castle i was trying to reach is right in front of me... I am peerless, and there is none to
        divert me
        anymore."</i>
</p>


<h3>Monster</h3>
<p>A manipulative character who is Johan liebert have an excellent knowledge about politics and literature. You will be
    influenced by all the moves from him in the given Anime.</p>

<h3>Vinland Saga</h3>
<p>Kind of vikings genre series where they wanted to highlight about the empathy and hard work.</p>
